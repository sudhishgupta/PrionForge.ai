<p align="center">AI‚ÄëPOWERED TOOL FOR GENERATING NOVEL "PRION-LIKE" PROTEINS WITH PRECISE SUBCELLULAR TARGETTING</p>


<h2 align='left'>üìã About</h2>
<p align='left'>Prions are a fascinating, yet pathogenic class of proteins which are infectious and cause several diseases in different species of living organisms including humans. Prions unlike conventional virus like infections which occur through nucleic acids (DNA/RNA), basically infect an organism by inducing a misfolding in normal proteins(similar to them), these misfolded proteins are not degraded easily and they aggregate over time, leading to several disorders. It has been shown that these prion-proteins have one thing in common, high Q/N content in their amino-acid composition, long-stretches of Glutamine and Arginine residues in repetition, leading to formation of prion-like domains, essential for the misfolding transmission.</p>

<p align='left'>PrionForge.ai is an AI-powered tool which is digging into generation of synthetic and novel prion-like sequences, with defined subcellular location, thanks to the advent of advanced "Protein-Language Models".</p>
